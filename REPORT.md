### Models

Each test will be performed on 

DNN

CNN + Attention

Attention + DNN


### Dataset

issue with test dataset and online available results, give examples

some scrap the test dataset others don't massive impact on accruacy

OOD generalization for test dataset

given our experiments are not trying to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen attack types, but more so the exact effect and scale of different attacks and attack prevention, it would be better to use only the training dataset split between train, validation and test to achieve ~99% accruacy. By doing so, it will be easier to measure the impact of our experiments, as we won't be getting confusion between our model simply failing as a result of poor model accuracy
